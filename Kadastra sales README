This was the first data set we were able to receive, a list of all property sales in the Czech Republic from 2014-2017.

The major aspect of cleaning it consisted of narrowing sales down to just the greater-Brno area, and then extracting the exact parcel
  numbers from a text description. For each type of property sale there was a particular pattern for where the parcel number was located.
  Using the rebus package and constructing functions to find them made after separating into the different parcel types made it possible.
  
  
Ultimately, this data set proved a dead-end for a few reasons:
  1) There was no easy way to access shapefiles for the Government-coded plot numbers, meaning to get the granularity we needed for an
      effective analysis we would have to find a pattern of how they were coded manually (impossible given time-constraints)
      
  2) We were unable to find the sales price of plots--only that they plots were sold. This meant we did not know whether they were bought
      because they were in an area of increasing interest, or if it was because they were cheap.
